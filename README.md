# bitcoincrush
Bitcoin Crush is a simple casual game I've developed from scratch.
I made it while studying Unity completely on my own.

Catch bitcoins controlling the picker and score some commission for each. Bitcoins are quickly rolling down from platforms, so try not to miss them, it makes you lose a life! You have 3 lives in total, refillable by collecting powerups.

- The game project itself
- Project Design document, which I followed to make this game

I also want to credit Stevia Sphere for the background music track "A Torrent Of Trouble". Source: https://steviasphere.bandcamp.com/album/software-piracy

I hope you enjoy my game!
